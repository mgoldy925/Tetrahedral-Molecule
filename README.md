# Tetrahedral-Molecule
This is a program simulating an atom with a tetrahedral molecular geometry, written in QB64.  The .bas file is used to run QB64 files in the IDE provided by https://qb64.org/.  In order to view the code, simply change the file extension of the .bas file to .txt or download the provided .txt file.

QB64 does not have 3D graphics (that I'm aware of), so these 3D graphics were manually created by recreating at a fundamental level how a computer displays 3D objects on a 2D screen.  The simulation runs a simulation of methane, CH4.  It accounts for the Coulombic repulsion between electrons and approximates the quantum mechanical force from th nucleus on each electron as if there is a spring between them.  In order to allow the system to settle into equilibrium, the electrons experience a drag force to gradually reduce the energy of the system.
